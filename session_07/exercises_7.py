# Session 7 Exercises

## Section A
# 1. Write a function that prints your name

# def print_name():
#     print("Joe")

# print_name()

# 2. Write a function that accepts a name as a parameter and prints "Hello, <name>".

# def hello(name):
#   print("hello " + name)

# hello("Joe")

# 3. Loop through the list ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"] and call the function you just wrote.

# names = {"Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"}
# for name in names:
#   hello(name)
  
# 4. Write a function that prints the area of two passed in parameters.

# def area(x, y):
#   print("The area is " + str(x * y))

# area(12,14)

# 5. Write a function called 'print_list' that accepts a list as a parameter and then prints out each item of the list.

# def print_list(fruits):
#     for fruit in fruits:
#         print(fruit)

# print_list(["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"])

# 6. Put the following into a function that accepts age as a parameter:
#     1. If they are younger than 11, print "You're too young to go to this school".
#     2. If they are between 11 and 16, print "You can can come to this school".
#     3. If they are over 16, print 'You're too old for school".
#     4. If they are 0, print "You're not born yet!".

# def school_eligibility(age):
#     if age < 11:
#         print("You're too young to go to this school.")
#     elif age >= 11 and age <= 16:
#         print("You can come to this school.")
#     elif age > 16:
#         print("You're too old for school.")
#     elif age == 0:
#         print("You're not born yet.")
#     else:
#         print("You didn't pick a number.")

# school_eligibility(19)

# <---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

## Section B
# 1. Write a function called is_odd that will return True or False if the integer passed as a parameter is odd (hint: x % 2 will return true for all odd numbers).

# def is_odd(x):
#   if x % 2:
#     return True
#   else:
#     return False
    
# is_odd(6)
# is_odd(5)

# 2. Write a function that accepts a word and returns it backwards, e.g. 'hello' -> 'olleh'.

# def reverse_word(name): 
#     new_string = ""
#     name_length = len(name)
#     while name_length != 0:
#         name_length -= 1
#         new_string += name[name_length]
#     return new_string

# 3. Write a recursive function that accepts a number and prints that number of stars, followed by ever decreasing stars on each line, E.g:
# ```
# *****
# ****
# ***
# **
# *
# ```

# def print_stars(x):
#     star = ""
#     for y in range(0, x):
#         star = star + "*"
#     print(star)
#     if x > 1:
#         print_stars(x-1)


# print_stars(10)

# 4. Create a padlock function. You need to be able to pass in a passcode and if its correct it should return "Unlock", else "Locked".

# def padlock(user_guess):

#     pin = 8450
#     if pin == user_guess:
#         print("Unlock")
#     else:
#         print("Locked")


# padlock(3423)
# padlock(8450)

# 5. Write a function that returns the sum of multiples of 3 and 5 between 0 and limit (parameter). 
#   For example, if limit is 20, it should return the sum of 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20.

# def multiples_3_and_5(limit):

#     sum = 0
    
#     for i in range (0, limit+1):
#         if limit < 0:
#             print("The limit must be greater than 0")
#         if i % 3 == 0:
#             sum += i
#         elif i % 5 == 0:
#             sum += i
    
#     print(sum)

# multiples_3_and_5(20)
    
# 6. Write a function called is_prime() that accepts a number and return True or False if the number of prime or not.

# def is_prime(num):
#   count = 0

#   for i in range(2, num):
#       if(num % i == 0):
#           count = count + 1
#           break

#   if (count == 0 and num != 1):
#       print(str(num) + " is a Prime Number")
#       return True
#   else:
#       print(str(num) +" is not a Prime Number")
#       return False

# is_prime(6)
# is_prime(99)
# is_prime(83)

# 7. Write a function that checks to see if a string is a pallindrome, if it is, it will return True and False if it is not.

# def pallindrome(word):
#     reverse_word = word[::-1]
#     if word == reverse_word:
#         print(True)
#     else:
#         print(False)

# pallindrome("strognsgag")
# pallindrome("abba")

# 8. Write a function that checks to see if a sentence is a pallindrome, if it is, it will return True and False if it is not. 
#   Tip - you may want to format your sentence so it is all lower case, and .replace() to get rid of white spaces.

# def pallindrome(sentence):
#   reverse_sentence = sentence[::-1]
#   if sentence == reverse_sentence:
#     print(True)
#   else:
#     print(False)

# pallindrome("a nut for a jar of tuna")

# def pallindrome_sen(sentence):
#     formatted_sen = sentence.lower()
#     new_sentence = formatted_sen.replace(' ', '')
#     rev_sentence = new_sentence[::-1]
#     if new_sentence == rev_sentence:
#         print(True)
#     else:
#         print(False)

# pallindrome_sen("The cat sat on the mat")
# pallindrome_sen("A nut for a jar of tuna")
