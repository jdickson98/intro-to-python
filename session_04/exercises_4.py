# Session 4 Exercises

## Section A
# 1. Create the following list of items: Apples, Cherries, Pears, Pineapple, Peaches, Mango. Then print the list.

# fruits = ["apples", "cherries", "pears", "pineapples", "peaches", "mango"]

# print(fruits)

# 2. Add "Grapes" to the list and print the list.

# fruits.append("grapes")
# print(fruits)

# 3. Change "Pears" to "Strawberries" and print the list.

# fruits[2] = "strawberries"
# print(fruits)

# 4. Remove "Apples" from the list and print the list.

# del(fruits[0])
# print(fruits)

# 5. Print out the current length of the list.

# print(len(fruits))

# 6. Order the list alphabetically.

# fruits.sort()
# print(fruits)

# 7. Print out the list again.

# print(fruits)

## Section B
# 1. Loop through the list you created in section A and print each item out.

# for edibles in fruits:
#   print(edibles)

# 2. Print the numbers 1 to 100 (including the number 100).

# for my_number in range(1, 101):
#     print(my_number)

# 3. Print all odd numbers from 1 to 100.

# for i in range(1, 101, 2):
#     print(i)
  
# 4. The modern olympics started in 1896, print the years they have been held (bonus points to skip the years it has not been held 1916, 1940, 1944, 2020).

# not_held = [1916, 1940, 1944, 2020]

# for olympic_year in range(1896, 2022, 4):
#     if olympic_year not in not_held:
#         print(olympic_year)

# 5. Create a list of ten random numbers. Loop through your list and count the number of even numbers and the number of odd numbers.

# numbers = [11, 67, 3, 56, 78, 99, 7, 34, 45, 100]
# even_count = 0
# odd_count = 0

# for i in numbers:
#     if i % 2 == 0:
#         even_count = even_count + 1
#     else:
#         odd_count += 1

# print("This list has " + str(even_count) + " even numbers and " + str(odd_count) + " odd numbers.")

# 6. Create a list of five names. Write a loop that will print "Hello" plus each name in the list.

# names = ["nigel", "alan", "ruth", "edith", "stuart"]

# for indivduals in names:
#   print("Hello " + indivduals)

# 7. Create a loop to go through each letter of the word "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious".

# word = "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"

# for letter in word:
#     print(letter)

# 8. Create a list of 5 numbers. Write a for loop which appends the square of each number to the new list.

# numbers = [12, 3, 5, 22, 14]
# sqr_numbers = []

# for i in numbers:
#     sqr_numbers.append(i ** 2)

# print(sqr_numbers)

# 9. Create a list with five names in. Write a for loop which appends  Dr. to each name in the new list.

# names = ["niamh", "joe", "sian", "lola", "lewis"]
# doctor = []

# for individuals in names:
#   doctor.append("dr. " + individuals)

# print(doctor)

# 10. FizzBuzz â€“ Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number and for multiples of five, print "Buzz". 
#    For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".

#     ```
#     1
#     2
#     Fizz
#     4
#     Buzz
#     Fizz
#     7
#     8
#     Fizz
#     Buzz
#     11
#     Fizz
#     13
#     14
#     FizzBuzz
#     ```

for number in range(1, 1001):
    if (number % 3 == 0) and (number % 5 == 0):
        print("FizzBuzz")
    elif (number % 3 == 0):
        print("Fizz")
    elif (number % 5 == 0):
        print("Buzz")
    else:
        print(number)
