# All of these questions will use a set of pre-made files with data in. The files are in the text_files directory.
# In order to access the text files from this file, make sure you get into the text_files directory when using read/write.
# Ex: f = open("text_files/austen.txt", "r") OR f = open("text_files/register.txt", "w")


## Section A
# 1. Read the file 'jabberwocky.txt' and print its content to the screen.

# f = open("text_files/jabberwocky.txt", "r")
# print(f.read())

# 2. Read the file 'austen.txt' and print the amount of lines in the file.

# total = 0
# f = open("text_files/austen.txt", "r")
# for x in f:
#   total += 1

# print(total)

# 3. Each line of the file 'numbers.txt' contains a number, write a script to add up all the values in the file.

# total = 0
# for x in open("text_files/numbers.txt"):
#     total += int(x)

# print(total)


# <---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

## Section B
# 1. Ask the user to enter their name and append this to a file called 'register.txt'.

# f = open("text_files/register.txt", "a")

# name = True
# while name:
#   name = input("what is your name")
#   f.write(name + "\n")

# f.close()

# 2. Create a new file called 'even.txt' that contains only the even numbers from the file 'numbers.txt'.

# f = open("text_files/even.txt", "w")

# for x in open("text_files/numbers.txt"):
#     x = int(x)
#     if x % 2 == 0:
#         f.write(str(x) + "\n")

# f.close()

# 3. 'secret.txt' contains a secret message. Each number represents the letter of the alphabet where 1 = A, 2 = B ... Z = 26. 
#    Work out what the secret message says.

# alphabet = {
#     0: "!",
#     1: "A",
#     2: "B",
#     3: "C",
#     4: "D",
#     5: "E",
#     6: "F",
#     7: "G",
#     8: "H",
#     9: "I",
#     10: "J",
#     11: "K",
#     12: "L",
#     13: "M",
#     14: "N",
#     15: "O",
#     16: "P",
#     17: "Q",
#     18: "R",
#     19: "S",
#     20: "T",
#     21: "U",
#     22: "V",
#     23: "W",
#     24: "X",
#     25: "Y",
#     26: "Z"
# }

# word = ""
# for x in open("text_files/secret.txt", "r"):
#     x = int(x)
#     word = word + alphabet[x]
# print(word)


# 4. Benford’s law states that the leading digits in a collection of data   are probably going to be small. 
#   For example, most numbers in a set (about 30%) will have a leading digit of 1, when the expected probability is 11.1% (i.e. one out of nine digits). 
#   Fake data is usually evenly distributed, where as real data tends to have noticeable spikes. The files 'accounts_1.txt', 'accounts_2.txt' and 'accounts_3.txt' contain financial transaction data. 
#   Work out which of the files contains fake data.
